## Overview

SHAMS (Simplified Hospital Appointments Management System) is a comprehensive solution aimed at revolutionizing the way hospitals manage appointments. Developed by a dedicated team led by Yves Irakoze Mfura and Twayinganyiki Leonce, SHAMS focuses on providing an efficient, user-friendly platform for patients, doctors, and administrators to streamline the appointment process.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Appointment Booking:** Patients can easily book appointments for specific medical services, selecting from a variety of options. The system intelligently assigns the appropriate doctor based on the chosen service, ensuring efficient care allocation.

- **Doctor Schedule Management:** Doctors have the ability to manage their appointment schedules seamlessly. They can update availability, block off time for breaks, and reschedule appointments as necessary, allowing for optimal time management.

- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:** Administrators have access to a powerful dashboard to oversee the entire appointment system. They can manage user roles, create new accounts, monitor system performance, and address any issues that arise, ensuring smooth operation.

## Challenges and Risks

While SHAMS offers significant benefits, it also faces challenges inherent in software development. Technical risks such as software bugs, data security vulnerabilities, and integration issues are mitigated through rigorous testing procedures and regular code reviews. Non-technical risks, such as resistance to change from hospital staff and user adoption issues, are addressed through strategies like user training and clear communication.
